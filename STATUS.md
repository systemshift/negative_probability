# Project Status: Quasi-Probability RL Research


## What's Been Built

### 1. Theoretical Framework (`THEORY.md`)
- Formal definition of quasi-probability Q-values (Q ∈ ℝ)
- Learning rules for forward and backward updates
- Action selection via quasi-probability sampling
- Mathematical foundation and motivation

### 2. Core Implementation (`qp_rl_v2/`)
- **`quasi_probability_agent.py`**: Two agents for comparison
  - `QuasiProbabilityAgent`: Full QP-RL with backward jumps
  - `ClassicalQAgent`: Standard Q-learning baseline

- **`grid_environment.py`**: Test environments
  - Configurable GridWorld with walls, traps, rewards
  - Pre-built environments: trap_maze, long_corridor, four_rooms

- **`experiment.py`**: Experiment runner
  - Side-by-side training and comparison
  - Statistical analysis across multiple runs

- **`visualization.py`**: Publication-quality plots
  - Learning curves
  - Policy visualizations
  - Quasi-probability heatmaps
  - Comparison bar charts

### 3. Main Experiment Script (`run_experiments.py`)
- Command-line interface for running experiments
- Automatic result collection and visualization
- Support for multiple environments and configurations

## Current Status

### ✅ What Works
1. **Clean theoretical framework** - Mathematically sound and well-documented
2. **Modular implementation** - Easy to extend and modify
3. **Side-by-side comparison** - Can directly compare QP-RL vs. Classical
4. **Visualization suite** - Publication-ready figures
5. **Reproducible experiments** - Multiple runs with statistics

### ⚠️ Current Challenge

**The backward jumps are currently hurting performance rather than helping.**

In initial experiments, the QP-RL agent performs worse than classical Q-learning:
- Classical: converges in ~99 episodes, 100% success rate
- QP-RL: converges in ~132 episodes, lower rewards

**Why?** The backward jumps waste samples. Each jump resets the agent to a past state, but doesn't provide new information - it just replays the same trajectory.

## Path Forward: Making This Publication-Worthy

### Option 1: Fix the Backward Jump Mechanism
The backward jumps need to be **strategic**, not random:

1. **Jump when stuck**: Only jump back if agent is in a bad state (trap, loop)
2. **Explore alternatives**: After jumping, try different actions than before
3. **Learn from counterfactuals**: Update Q-values based on "what if" scenarios

**Implementation idea**:
```python
if stuck_in_trap or reward < threshold:
    # Jump back to decision point
    jump_state = find_last_good_state()
    # Try untried actions
    action = explore_alternative(jump_state)
```

### Option 2: Hindsight Experience Replay Integration
Combine with HER (Hindsight Experience Replay):
- Use backward jumps to create synthetic "success" experiences
- Reinterpret failed trajectories as successes for different goals
- This would be a novel contribution: "QP-RL + HER"

### Option 3: Prioritized Backward Jumps
- Maintain priority queue of "interesting" past states
- Jump to states with high uncertainty or potential for discovery
- Similar to prioritized experience replay, but for temporal navigation

### Option 4: Different Problem Domain
Current grid worlds may not showcase the benefit. Try:
- **Maze with one-way doors**: Can't go back normally, need temporal navigation
- **Puzzle-like environments**: Need to undo mistakes
- **Sparse reward with traps**: Classical gets stuck, QP-RL escapes

## Recommendation for Research Paper

### Quick Win: Make It Work
1. **Reduce backward jump probability** to 0.05-0.1 (currently 0.3)
2. **Add strategic jumping**: Only jump when performance degrades
3. **Test on harder environments**: Four rooms, long corridor

### For Publication Quality
1. **Clear motivation**: Why do we need temporal navigation?
2. **Theoretical contribution**: Formal analysis of quasi-probabilities
3. **Empirical results**: Show clear advantage on specific task types
4. **Ablation studies**: Test each component (forward update, backward update, jumps)
5. **Comparison with related work**: HER, temporal abstraction, options framework

## How to Use

### Quick Test
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip3 install numpy matplotlib --break-system-packages

# Run quick experiment
python3 run_experiments.py --episodes 300 --runs 2
```

### Full Experiment Suite
```bash
# Run on all environments with full statistics
python3 run_experiments.py --all --episodes 1500 --runs 5
```

### Custom Experiments
```python
from qp_rl_v2 import QuasiProbabilityAgent, GridWorld
from qp_rl_v2.experiment import compare_agents

# Create custom environment
env = GridWorld(rows=10, cols=10, walls=[...], traps=[...])

# Compare agents
qp_results, classical_results = compare_agents(env, n_episodes=1000, n_runs=5)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Debug backward jumps**: Make them strategic, not random
2. **Design better test environments**: Showcase when temporal navigation helps
3. **Run comprehensive experiments**: Gather data for paper
4. **Write paper draft**: Theory + experiments + results

## Code Quality

The implementation is:
- ✅ Clean and well-documented
- ✅ Modular and extensible
- ✅ Research-grade quality
- ✅ Ready for release with paper
- ⚠️ Needs algorithmic improvement for performance gains

## Notes

- The comparison framework is solid - can directly test any modifications
- Visualization suite is publication-ready
- Theoretical foundation is sound
- **Main challenge**: Making backward jumps actually help (not hurt) performance

This is a good foundation for a research paper. The key is demonstrating **when and why** quasi-probabilities help, not just that they're theoretically interesting.
