def create_deceptive_reward_maze():

    Creates a maze environment with deceptive rewards - areas with high immediate
    rewards that lead to dead ends, while the true optimal path initially has
    lower rewards.
    
    This environment specifically challenges standard RL algorithms because:
    1. Standard Q-learning will be drawn to the high-reward paths
    2. Escaping these deceptive reward traps requires backtracking
    3. Temporal credit assignment is difficult with standard approaches

    Creates an environment with history-dependent dynamics, where the effect of
